## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
spotify2023 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Jjtra/Desktop/spotify4220/spotify2023.csv")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Question 1

First graph is an extremely simple histogram that looks at spotify chart rankings.
In this graph, it is skewed right due to many songs being extremely high in
both chart ranking and the frequency of those songs.


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

spotcharts <- spotify2023$in_spotify_charts
hist(spotcharts, main='Spotify Charts', xlab='Number of songs in Spotify')
```


The second graph displays a scatter plot that compares chart rankings in 
accordance to the perceived energy of the song. Energy in this case being 
something like being very active/generating hype, not to be confused with 
valence (positivity) and danceability. Each point is a song that shows both 
the ranking and amount of energy. As you can see, many high ranking songs are 
also high in energy.

```{r}
ggplot(spotify2023, aes(energy_.,in_spotify_charts)) + 
  labs(title = "Energy and Spotify Chart Ranking", x = "Energy", y = "Chart Ranking") +
  geom_point(aes(colour = 'red'))
```

## Question 2: Mean

Below is a simple mean of energy of the most popular songs in Spotify 2023. 
If you compare the mean to the previous graph, it does show that most songs 
have the energy between 50 and 75, albeit, hard to exactly conclude. The 
mean being 64 sort of supports this.

```{r}
energy_mean <- mean(spotify2023$energy_.)
energy_mean
```
## Question 3: Correlation Test using Pearson

I used the Pearson method to find correlation between the energy and dancbility 
of songs. According to the results, the p-value for this test is less than 5%, 
which means there is a correlation between the energy and danceability. In 
other words, the energy percieved directly or closely interacts danceability 
(ex. high energy means higher danceability of a song). This also rejects the 
null hypothesis, which in this case was that energy and danceability has little 
to no correalation.
```{r}
cor.test(spotify2023$danceability_.,spotify2023$energy_., method = 'pearson')
```
## Question 4: T-Test

This is a 2 sample t-test between popular songs between the years 2016-2019 and 
2020-2023. The hypothesis for this test is to see if more relevant songs have 
more energy than pre-2020 songs. The Null Hypothesis in this case would be the 
opposite, other wise meaning that pre-2020 songs have a higher energy 
perception than the more relevent songs. The p-value in this case is just below 
.05, which means that we can reject the null hypothesis. The mean value for x 
(post-2020) is higher than y (pre-2020). As for the exact reason as to it is 
significant why is unknown (could be due to key and mode).

```{r}

spotge2019 <- filter(spotify2023, released_year > 2019)
spotle2016 <- filter(spotify2023, released_year <= 2019 & released_year >= 2016)
t.test(spotge2019$energy_., spotle2016$energy_.)

```
