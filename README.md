# Most Popular Songs of Spotify 2023 

This is a dataset contains music from various artists. It includes thing such as energy, key of the song, etc. 
I chose this dataset because I'm interested in how many songs are written in a certain key and if 
that has any correlation with any other parameters in the set (energy, danceability, likes, streams, etc.)

### More Details on the Data Set

As already stated, this data set contains information pertaining to the most popular songs recorded in Spotify
2023. It contains the percieved percentage value of energy, danceability, etc. on a scale of 1 - 100%.
It also includes the date of creation/uploaded onto spotify by separate columns of year, month and day. 

### Purpose of this Project

The purpose of this project allows the calculation and comparsions of various queries 
concerning the dataset. It may include things like most popular key scale based on count, 
various calculations based numerical values (energy, liveliness, etc.), and things alike.
The goal of this project is to figure out if there are any correalations with how people 
tend to like music.
